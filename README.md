# Recipe Master

The goal of this repository is to showcase a fairly simple android application. It is developed using various good practices: TDD, UI-testing, using popular third party libraries,... It presents a recipe application where one can find various recipes coming from a backend server (in this case a Wiremock stub). The user can also manage its refrigerator and shopping list.
